# Algorithm

## Problem

A party wants a translator between english and "pirate language."

## Preprocessing

The Program will have hardcoded values of words to be translated.
This will be used to programmatically generate a conversion dictionary.

## Processing

1. Input will be gathered and parsed.
2. Conversion Dictionary will be generated.
3. If possible, word will be translated. If not, it is skipped.
4. Final translation is parsed and output to `stdout`.
